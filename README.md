# TeensyTester
 A simple pcb for testing teensy IO and interfaces
 
 Please note that older versions of the Tester (before 1.1) has a silk screen error on the bottom left side of the PCB. Under both SPI_VOUT and I2C_VOUT, it should be that the right sides are 5V and left sides are 3.3V. There is no electrical change since then, just silk-screen changes to correct this mistake. 
 
 By default, please use 3.3V (right side), and in some cases, I hard-wired it to be so.
